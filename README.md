Software Test Automation &amp; QA

My project submission goes into detail about how I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, and how I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program.
As a brief recap, security is ensured through testing each section of code for vulnerabilities, functionality is ensured through dynamic tests that prove the code works, and the user's needs can be ensured by appropriate user feedback.
My approach to designing software would depend on the software itself.
Every program is different, so it is important to have design document and development plans that match each projects unique requirements.
